# libprojfs

A Linux projected filesystem library, similar in concept to the Windows
[Projected File System][winprojfs] and developed in conjunction with the
[VFSForGit][vfs4git] project.

## Design

See the [design document](/docs/design.md).

## Getting Started

*TBD*

## Contributing

*TBD with Code of Conduct*

## Licensing

libprojfs is licensed under the [LGPL v2.1](COPYING). See the [NOTICE](NOTICE)
file for a list of other licenses used in the project, and in the comments in
each file for the licenses applicable to them.

## Development Roadmap

We are developing the libprojfs library first, using FUSE to prototype
and test its performance, before migrating functionality into a
Linux kernel module (assuming that proves to be necessary to meet
our performance criteria).

The VFSForGit API, which is currently supported through the use of
the `--enable-vfs-api` configuration option to libprojfs, may at some
point refactored out of this library entirely and handled exclusively
within Linux-specific code in the VFSForGit project.  However, for
the moment it has proven efficient to keep it within this library
while libprojfs undergoes rapid early development.
